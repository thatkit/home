# Personal Portfolio Page

## Description
My first portfolio page. I am planning it to be pretty much static at first, but refined later on.

## Languages
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript ES6

## UI/UX Design
The prototype was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

## Ideology
There is an idea, that seems to me to be interesting, but I will try to implement it after all the basic features are added and fully functionable.
